MISTEuv (Beta)
--------------

MISTEuv was developed to estimate missing unit-value streamflow data for USGS streamflow-gaging stations. Estimates are generated using a generalized additive model (GAM) with one or two index streamflow-gaging stations.

Software
--------

If R (version 3.3 or greater) is not already installed on your computer, download and install the latest binary distribution from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/)). R can also be run from RStudio, which is a nice interface for working with R and provides a console. In order to use RStudio, R must be installed first. The latest version of RStudio is available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). R and RStudio should be accessible from the start menu, a desktop shortcut, or via command shell. Assuming you installed R on a 64-bit operating system (OS), two versions of R are made available, that is, a 32-bit and 64-bit version. The 64-bit version of R (R x64) is preferred. In order to add the USGS Geological Survey R Archive Network, or the [GRAN](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/gran.html), as a repository from which to download USGS R packages;

``` r
rprofile_path = file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".Rprofile")
write('\noptions(repos=c(getOption(\'repos\'),
    CRAN=\'https://cloud.r-project.org\',
    USGS=\'https://owi.usgs.gov/R\'))\n',
      rprofile_path, 
      append =  TRUE)
```

Installation
------------

To install and launch MISTEuv;

``` r
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("bbreaker-USGS/MISTEuv")

MISTEuv::MISTEuvgui()
```

The following code may be used prior to the previous code if an error occurs related to the `devtools::install_github()` function.

```r
library(httr)

set_config(config(ssl_verifypeer = 0L))
```
